 <!-- TSOC's Mission -->
    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>Tree Squirrels of California helps people understand and protect the state’s native tree squirrels—especially the Western Gray and Douglas squirrels. Through squirrel ID tools, habitat awareness, and citizen science, we guide California’s squirrel friends and foes alike toward better choices and peaceful coexistence.</p>

<hr>
    <p>The squirrels that live today around humans were introduced by people who wanted to “re-nature” urban and county parks.</p>
    <p>The native California squirrels still thrive in the wild. It's important to remember that it is the non-natives that most people interact with.</p>

    <h3>Our Concern</h3>
    <p>Tree Squirrels of California was founded to help people understand squirrels better regardless of their point of view. It’s helpful to know what you can do about them if they are causing damage. Squirrels are playful, cute and intelligent, but also can be highly destructive and can carry diseases that affect humans.</p>
    <p>Many pest control websites do a great job of explaining removal options, but it’s complicated because the laws vary with different types of squirrels. Studies show that human activities play a big role in allowing squirrels to cause damage in the first place. In many cases, there are ways to limit squirrel damage without the need for extermination or removal.</p>

    <p>It's important to remember that squirrels are wild animals and your interactions with them are regulated by state and local laws. Tree Squirrels of California is here to keep you up to date on these laws and also to dispel common misconceptions about these enthusiastic rodents so that we can better coexist.</p>

      <p>This website was built as a class assignment for the Summer 2025 semester of CS50A at Santa Rosa Junior College, taught by Beaury Foshée. “Tree Squirrels of California” is a fictitious organization. Nonetheless, I have endeavored to be as accurate as possible with all of the information about squirrels, news articles, and hunting information.</p>
