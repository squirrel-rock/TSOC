         <h2>Tree Squirrels of California</h2>
    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Tree Squirrels of California - (T.S.O.C) </strong>helps people understand and protect the state’s <strong>two native tree squirrels</strong>—the Western Gray and Douglas squirrels—and offers guidance on how to live responsibly with the <strong>two introduced species</strong>. Through squirrel ID tools, habitat awareness, and citizen science, we guide California’s squirrel friends and foes alike toward better choices and peaceful coexistence.

    <h2>Some people adore squirrels. </h2>
    <h2>Some... don’t. Let’s break it down.</h2>

    <section class="list-block center my-30">

    <h3>Tree Squirrel Love?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Delightful to watch, film and photograph</li>
      <li>Plant trees by forgetting buried acorns</li>
      <li>Help forests thrive by dispersing seeds and fungi</li>
      <li>They teach us about ecosystems and wildlife intelligence</li>
      <li>They’re just plain cute!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tree Squirrel Woes?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Digging up plants in gardens</li>
      <li>Chewing on wires, nesting in buildings and stripping tree bark</li>
      <li>Raiding bird feeders and picnic tables</li>
      <li>Non-natives threaten native squirrels and other native wildlife</li>
      <li>They sometimes carry parasites or disease</li>

    <h3>Our Concern</h3>
   <p><strong>T.S.O.C </strong> was founded to help people understand squirrels better regardless of their point of view. It’s helpful to know what you can do about squirrels if they are causing damage. Squirrels are playful, cute and intelligent, but also can be highly destructive and can carry diseases that affect humans.</p>
 <p >Many pest control websites do a great job of explaining removal options, but it’s complicated because the laws vary with different types of squirrels. Studies show that human activities play a big role in allowing squirrels to cause damage in the first place. In many cases, there are ways to limit squirrel damage without the need for extermination or removal.</p>

    <h3>What We Do</h3>
       
 <p><strong>Tree Squirrels of California</strong> is dedicated to providing accurate information about the tree squirrels of the West Coast and how to distinguish them from other types of rodents in the squirrel family, <em>Sciuridae</em>.</p>

<p>It's important to remember that squirrels are wild animals and your interactions with them are guided by state and local laws. <strong>T.S.O.C </strong> is here to keep you up to date on these laws and also to dispel common misconceptions about these enthusiastic rodents so that we can better coexist.</p>
<h3> A Personal Note</h3>
<p>
  This website started out as a class project when I was learning to code, but developing this squirrel education website has turned into a beloved pastime. I started with California because it’s where I live, but the Eastern Gray squirrel has been exported to other countries with much worse effects than here. Our Douglas Squirrel is the 'red' <em><strong>Tamiasciurus</strong></em> genera that is native here, and its habitat is not yet dangerously threatened by the Eastern Gray. This may be due, in part, to Western Grays forming a living buffer between the Easterns, the Fox Squirrels, and the conifer forests.</p>

<p>There are fox squirrels I see regularly running along the power lines at the top of the hill, just outside the local redwoods. The Western Gray population is strong here and generally keeps them out of the forest itself, which helps preserve the forest for the Douglas Squirrels too. Our little patch of forest is surrounded by orchards, vineyards, and housing, so fox squirrels are essentially right at our borders. But places like Ireland, Italy, and much of Europe don’t have a local guardian species like that for their red squirrels, and the situation there is much more precarious for <em>Tamiasciurus</em> species.
</p>


<p class="border center"><strong>Western Gray Squirrels may be shy of humans</strong> and seem docile, but they are fierce and highly territorial around non-native species of squirrels.<br>

  <summary><strong>What about Oregon and Washington?</strong></summary>
<p>
    While this site focuses on tree squirrels in California, it's worth noting that many of the same native species, the Western Gray and Douglas squirrels, are native to the entire Pacific Coastal region, including Oregon, Washington and British Columbia. Management practices and protections vary by state and country, so this website is focused on California laws and habitat conditions.
  </p>

<p>
    In <strong>Washington</strong>, the Western Gray Squirrel is listed as a threatened species. A 2007 estimate put the statewide population between 468 and 1,405 individuals, based on data from 1994–2005. Estimated net habitat loss from 1993 to 2017 was <strong>20.8% in the North Cascades</strong> and <strong>21.2% in the South Cascades</strong>, due to wildfires and timber harvest (Vander Haegen et al., 2022).
  </p>



<p>
    Eastern Gray and Fox squirrels were introduced at the same time in Oregon and Washington as in California (late 1800's to early 1900's), where they currently pose similar problems as in California. For identification help in those states, we highly recommend Oregon State University’s outstanding squirrel reference site:

    (also includes info on American Red Squirrels, which do not occur in California.)
