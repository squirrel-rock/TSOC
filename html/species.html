<h3>Non-native Squirrels - Introduced from Eastern US - early 1900's</h3>

<p>
    <blockquote class="block-invader">
  The introduced eastern gray and eastern fox squirrel thrive in human-dominated landscapes like city parks, suburban backyards and attics, and nut orchards, and are very familiar sights (and often, pests) to most Californians. <strong>They’re nearly as ecologically flexible as rats</strong> and are perfectly happy to nest close to humans and to eat the same native plants as western grays, plus human garbage and non-native plants that the westerns won’t touch.
      <cite>Bay Nature, May 2019</cite>

</p>
  
<p class="info-box-p">
  The first documented release of Fox Squirrels in California occurred around 1904 at the Veterans’ Home in Sawtelle (West Los Angeles).  
  Civil War and Spanish‑American War veterans brought them from the Midwest as pets and released them on the grounds.  
  Since then, Fox Squirrels have become well established in Southern California and continue to expand into suburban and foothill landscapes.  
<br><br>
These squirrels now dominate many urban and suburban areas. Although they were introduced by humans just over a hundred years ago, a brief period in ecological terms, their presence has begun to shift the ecological balance in unexpected ways.</p>

<h3>A Gentle Reminder</h3>
    <p>The squirrels that live today in California's urban areas and much of its suburban areas, business parks and college campuses were introduced by people who wanted to “re-nature” urban areas or by people binging them in as pets that were released or escaped. .</p>
    <p>The native California squirrels still thrive in the wild but are increasingly being pushed away both by habitat reduction and the more adaptable invasive squirrels. It's important to remember that it is the non-natives that most people interact with.</p>

  Squirrel Identification Matters

<h4>Accurate squirrel identification can help protect a species.</h4>

<p><strong>As of 2023, Western Gray Squirrels are officially listed as endangered in the state of Washington</strong>, with fewer than 1,500 remaining in the state. In Oregon, they're listed as a <em>sensitive species</em>, with populations declining in key oak-woodland regions.
