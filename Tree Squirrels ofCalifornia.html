    <p style="background-color: #ffffff; padding: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px; text-align: center;">
      To many people, squirrels bring joy. They’re playful, acrobatic, and a little mischievous. <br>Seeing one leap through the trees or chatter on a branch can be uplifting and bring a smile.

    <h2>What’s Native—and What’s Not?</h2>

    <p>In California, there are now four established tree squirrel species, but only two are native. These two species evolved in this landscape and remain in balance with the ecosystems.</p>
<h3>West Coast Native Tree Squirrels</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Western Gray Squirrel</strong> (<em>Sciurus griseus</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Douglas Squirrel</strong> (<em>Tamiasciurus douglasii</em>)</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Non-native Squirrels - Introduced from Eastern US - early 1900's</h3>
  
<p>
  The first documented release of Fox Squirrels in California occurred around 1904 at the Veterans’ Home in Sawtelle (West Los Angeles).  
  Civil War and Spanish‑American War veterans brought them from the Midwest as pets and released them on the grounds.  
  Since then, Fox Squirrels have become well established in Southern California and continue to expand into suburban and foothill landscapes.  
</p>

<p>These squirrels now dominate many urban and suburban areas. Although they were introduced by humans just over a hundred years ago, a brief period in ecological terms, their presence has begun to shift the ecological balance in unexpected ways.</p>

    <blockquote>
      They’re nearly as ecologically flexible as rats and are perfectly happy to nest close to humans and to eat the same native plants as western grays, plus human garbage and non-native plants that the westerns won’t touch.
      <cite>Bay Nature, May 2019</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Eastern Gray Squirrel</strong> (<em>Sciurus carolinensis</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Fox Squirrel</strong> (<em>Sciurus niger</em>)</li>
    </ul>

  Why Squirrel Identification Matters
</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center; ">Accurate squirrel identification can help protect a species.</h4>

  <p style="background-color: #ffffff; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px; color:rgb(148, 8, 8); text-align: center;"><strong>Western Gray Squirrels are now endangered in Washington</strong> due to habitat loss and population decline, with fewer than 1,500 remaining in the state. In Oregon, they're listed as a <em>sensitive species</em>, with populations declining in key oak-woodland regions.</p>

  <h4 style="text-align: center;">In California, it’s up to us to prevent that fate. By recognizing our native squirrels and protecting their habitat now, we can help avoid disaster in our forests.</h4>

    <h2>Some people adore squirrels. Some… don’t. Let’s break it down.</h2>

    <h3>Tree Squirrel Love?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Delightful to watch, film and photograph</li>
      <li>Plant trees by forgetting buried acorns</li>
      <li>Help forests thrive by dispersing seeds and fungi</li>
      <li>They teach us about ecosystems and wildlife intelligence</li>
      <li>They’re just plain cute!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tree Squirrel Woes?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Digging up plants in gardens</li>
      <li>Chewing on wires, wood buildings and stripping tree bark</li>
      <li>Raiding bird feeders and picnic tables</li>
      <li>Non-natives threaten native squirrels and other native wildlife</li>
      <li>They sometimes carry parasites or disease</li>

<h2>Tree Squirrels vs. Ground Squirrels and Chipmunks</h2>

<h3>Ground Squirrel Species</h3>
<p>
  The most commonly seen ground squirrel in California is the <strong>California Ground Squirrel</strong> (also known as the Beechey Ground Squirrel), which ranges across much of the state.  
  However, California is home to <strong>at least 10 species</strong> of ground squirrels, many of which are tied to specific habitats, from alpine meadows to desert valleys.  
  Some, such as the <strong>Mohave Ground Squirrel</strong> and the <strong>San Joaquin Antelope Ground Squirrel</strong>, are <strong>state-listed as threatened</strong> and face pressure from habitat loss.
</p>

<h3>Chipmunk Species</h3>
<p>
  California hosts <strong>13 distinct chipmunk species</strong>, all in the genus <em>Neotamias</em>. Unlike the California Ground Squirrel, chipmunks tend to have <strongn>narrower geographic ranges and are often adapted to specific elevations or forest types.  
  There is no single chipmunk species that is ubiquitous across the state. For example, the <strong>Sonoma Chipmunk</strong> is localized to the North Coast region, while others live exclusively in alpine zones or southern mountain ranges. None of these populations are currently considered at risk.

<h3>How Do Tree Squirrels Differ from Ground Squirrels and Chipmunks?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Nesting:</strong> Tree squirrels build nests in trees. Ground squirrels and chipmunks dig burrows underground.</li>
  <li><strong>Escape:</strong> Tree squirrels flee upward into trees. Ground squirrels and chipmunks retreat to burrows when alarmed.</li>
  <li><strong>Vocalization:</strong> Ground squirrels shriek in alarm. Tree squirrels scold after reaching safety. Chipmunks often give sharp, high-pitched “chip-chip” calls.</li>
  <li><strong>Cheek pouches:</strong> Ground squirrels and chipmunks both have cheek pouches for carrying food. Tree squirrels do not.</li>
  <li><strong>Tail:</strong> Tree squirrels have long, bushy tails. Ground squirrels have thinner tails, and chipmunks have short, flat tails with less plume.</li>
  <li><strong>Markings:</strong> Chipmunks are smaller and have distinct stripes on their backs and heads. Ground squirrels may have spots or stripes. Tree squirrels have neither.</li>
</ul>

<!------------  FLYING SQUIRREL SECTION  ----------------------->

    <h2>What About Flying Squirrels?</h2>
    <img src="./Tree Squirrels of California_files/humbolt-TripleSquirrel_228319357.jpg" alt="Flying squirrel gliding and landing in sequence">

    <h3>Flying Squirrels are Not Tree Squirrels</h3>
    <p>In fact, marmots are more closely related to tree squirrels than flying squirrels are!</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Subfamily:</strong> Flying squirrels belong to <em>Pteromyinae</em></li>
  <li><strong>Activity Cycle:</strong> Nocturnal—active at night, unlike diurnal tree squirrels</li>
  <li><strong>Locomotion:</strong> Gliders that steer in the air with their flat tail. On the ground, their movement is awkward and limited—they rely on trees to travel and escape danger. Their gliding ability comes from a skin membrane called the <em>patagium</em>, which stretches between their wrists and ankles.</li>
  <li><strong>Diet:</strong> Primarily fungi, lichens, tree sap, and occasionally insects</li>
  <li><strong>Predators:</strong> Owls, martens, raccoons, coyotes, and domestic cats</li>
</ul>
