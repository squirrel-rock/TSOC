    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p class="p-info-white">
  <strong>Tree Squirrels of California - (T.S.O.C) </strong>helps people understand and protect the state’s <strong>two native tree squirrels</strong>—the Western Gray and Douglas squirrels—and offers guidance on how to live responsibly with the <strong>two introduced species</strong>. Through squirrel ID tools, habitat awareness, and citizen science, we guide California’s squirrel friends and foes alike toward better choices and peaceful coexistence.

<!-- WHY CARE -->

    <h2>Some people adore squirrels. </h2>
    <h2>Some... don’t. Let’s break it down.</h2>

    <section class="list-block center my-30">

    <h3>Tree Squirrel Love?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Delightful to watch, film and photograph</li>
      <li>Plant trees by forgetting buried acorns</li>
      <li>Help forests thrive by dispersing seeds and fungi</li>
      <li>They teach us about ecosystems and wildlife intelligence</li>
      <li>They’re just plain cute!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tree Squirrel Woes?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Digging up plants in gardens</li>
      <li>Chewing on wires, nesting in buildings and stripping tree bark</li>
      <li>Raiding bird feeders and picnic tables</li>
      <li>Non-natives threaten native squirrels and other native wildlife</li>
      <li>They sometimes carry parasites or disease</li>

    <h3>Our Concern</h3>
   <p class="p-info-white"><strong>T.S.O.C </strong> was founded to help people understand squirrels better regardless of their point of view. It’s helpful to know what you can do about squirrels if they are causing damage. Squirrels are playful, cute and intelligent, but also can be highly destructive and can carry diseases that affect humans.</p>
 <p class="p-info-white">Many pest control websites do a great job of explaining removal options, but it’s complicated because the laws vary with different types of squirrels. Studies show that human activities play a big role in allowing squirrels to cause damage in the first place. In many cases, there are ways to limit squirrel damage without the need for extermination or removal.</p>

   <h3 >A Note on the Pacific Northwest</h3>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What about Oregon and Washington?</strong></summary>
<p class="p-info-white">
    While this site focuses on tree squirrels in California, it's worth noting that many of the same native species, the Western Gray and Douglas squirrels, are also native to Oregon and Washington. Management practices and protections vary by state, so we concentrate here on California laws and conditions.
  </p>

<p class="p-info-white">
    In <strong>Washington</strong>, the Western Gray Squirrel is listed as a threatened species. A 2007 estimate put the statewide population between 468 and 1,405 individuals, based on data from 1994–2005. Estimated net habitat loss from 1993 to 2017 was <strong>20.8% in the North Cascades</strong> and <strong>21.2% in the South Cascades</strong>, due to wildfires and timber harvest (Vander Haegen et al., 2022).
  </p>



<p class="p-info-white">
    Eastern Gray and Fox squirrels were introduced at the same time in Oregon and Washington as in California (late 1800's to early 1900's), where they currently pose similar problems as in California. For identification help in those states, we highly recommend Oregon State University’s outstanding squirrel reference site:

    (also includes info on American Red Squirrels, which do not occur in California.)
